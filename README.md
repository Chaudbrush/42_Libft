# 42_Libft
This project consists in creating a personal static library with useful functions to be used during the 42 School curriculum.

---

### How to use?
Compile the `main.c` file linking it with the library:

```bash
cc main.c -L. -lft
```

---

### Testing
I'm using personal tests to test the functions individually. Below are some other testers Im using to make sure everything is correct.
